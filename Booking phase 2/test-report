- **Excluded:** Admin features, reservation system, session management

## **Test Approach**
Gray-box testing

## **Test Environment & Dates**
- **Date:** *18 Feb 2026*  
- **Environment:**
  - macOS  
  - Docker Desktop  
  - PostgreSQL (Docker)  
  - Chrome

# **2. Executive Summary**

The updated application (Phase 2) was tested to verify whether the vulnerabilities from Phase 1 and Part 2 were fixed.  
Most major issues have been fixed in this version.  
The system shows significant improvement in security.

**Overall Fix Status:** Most issues fixed, except HTTPS.

# **3. Verification of Findings (Phase 2)**

## **F-01: Plain-text Password Storage**
- **Status:** Fixed  
- Passwords are now stored as hashed values  
- Verified by checking the `booking_users` table

- XSS payloads blocked

## **F-03: No HTTPS**
- **Status:** Not Fixed  
- Application still runs on HTTP (`http://localhost:8003`)

## **F-04: Missing Security Headers**
- **Status:** Fixed  
- ZAP Round 3 shows CSP, X-Frame-Options, and X-Content-Type-Options present

## **F-05: No CSRF Protection**
- **Status:** Fixed  
- Login request includes CSRF token  
- ZAP Round 3 confirms CSRF protection

---

# **4. Evidence Summary (Phase 2)**

- Database query shows hashed passwords  
- SQLi and XSS payloads rejected  
- Application accessed over HTTP  
- ZAP Round 3 reports security headers present  
- ZAP Round 3 confirms CSRF token in login request  

---

# **5. ZAP Round 3 Summary**

| **Scan Round** | **Result** |
|----------------|------------|
| Round 1 | Multiple high-risk issues |
| Round 2 | Same issues remained |
| Round 3 | Most issues fixed |

ZAP Round 3 shows no high-risk vulnerabilities.

---

# **6. Conclusion**

The updated version of the Booking System (Phase 2) has fixed most of the vulnerabilities identified in earlier phases.  
Password hashing, input validation, CSRF protection, and security headers have been successfully implemented.

**Remaining Issue:**  
- Application still uses HTTP instead of HTTPS.

Overall, Phase 2 is significantly more secure and stable compared to Phase 1 and Part 2.
